# Awesome Bitcoin Payment Processors [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of awesome bitcoin payment processors and stories from merchants using them. Why are they awesome? Because they process native bitcoin transactions and don't require wallets to use the [controversial payment protocol](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/169222582782/bitpay-qr-codes-are-no-longer-valid-important). More supported wallets = more customers!
