# Awesome Bitcoin Payment Processors [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of awesome bitcoin payment processors and stories from merchants using them. Why are they awesome?

1. They are either protected against financial censorship or they don't practice it.
2. They process native bitcoin transactions and don't require wallets to use the [controversial payment protocol](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/169222582782/bitpay-qr-codes-are-no-longer-valid-important).

## Self-Hosted Payment Processors

Self-Hosted payment processors run on your server and provide you with a full control over the entire payment process and funds. There's no third-party involvement - that significantly increases the censorship-resistance, privacy, and security for you and your customers. 

| Processor | Fees | Lightning | Directly to Your Wallet | Conversion to Fiat | Notes |
| --------- |:----:|:---------:|:-----------------------:|:------------------:| ----- |
| [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) | No fees | YES | YES | Via [Payment Forwarding](https://www.blockonomics.co/views/payment_forwarding.html) | |
| [Cashier-BTC](https://github.com/Overtorment/Cashier-BTC) | No fees | no | YES | no | |
| [CryptoWoo](https://www.cryptowoo.com/) | $34 - $99 per license | no | YES | no | For WooCommerce only |

## Hosted Payment Processors

Hosted payment processors run on someone else's server. This simplifies the initial setup process, but reduces the amount of control you have over the payment process and even funds, if they use their wallets for receiving payments.
